# Notebooks: Supporting Calculations

This folder contains supporting calculations for the Entropic Scalar Field Theory project.

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `velocity_tests.ipynb` | Tests related to velocity calculations in the context of the theory. |
| `local_field_theory_tests.ipynb` | Explorations of local field theory aspects. |
| `many_pasts_tests.ipynb` | Investigations into the concept of many pasts within the framework. |

These notebooks are exploratory proofs-of-concept and may be polished in future updates.
