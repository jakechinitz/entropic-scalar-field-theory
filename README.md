## About this Project
This project presents a self-contained scalar field theory where mass, gravity, time, and gauge structure emergy from local entanglement deficits relative to the vaccum. The field theory is fully mapped to Group Field Theory (GFT), Information-Complete QFT (ICQFT), and holographically embedded in AdS/CFT.

Gravity, Mass, and Time from Entanglement Deficit

This repository contains the main paper and supplementary materials for the Entropic Scalar Field Theory. The theory explores the emergence of gravity, mass, and time from entanglement entropy, offering a unified perspective on quantum origins.

## Summary

The theory proposes that gravity, mass, and time emerge from the entanglement entropy of quantum fields. It provides a framework for understanding the fundamental nature of these phenomena and their interconnectedness.

## Equations

The following equations are central to the theory:

1. **Entanglement Entropy:**
   \[ S = -\text{Tr}(\rho \log \rho) \]

2. **Emergent Gravity:**
   \[ F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \]

3. **Time Dilation:**
   \[ t' = t \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \]
