## About this Project
This project presents an original entropic scalar field theory, deriving gravitational and quantum dynamics from first-principles information theory. It includes full derivations, code notebooks for reproduction, and a published DOI-linked paper. The framework unifies gravity and quantum fields through entanglement entropy gradients, providing an alternative to dark matter, dark energy, and inflation models.

# entropic-scalar-field-theory# Entropic Scalar Field Theory
Gravity, Mass, and Time from Entanglement Deficit

This repository contains the main paper and supplementary materials for the Entropic Scalar Field Theory. The theory explores the emergence of gravity, mass, and time from entanglement entropy, offering a unified perspective on quantum origins.

## Summary

The theory proposes that gravity, mass, and time emerge from the entanglement entropy of quantum fields. It provides a framework for understanding the fundamental nature of these phenomena and their interconnectedness.

## Equations

The following equations are central to the theory:

1. **Entanglement Entropy:**
   \[ S = -\text{Tr}(\rho \log \rho) \]

2. **Emergent Gravity:**
   \[ F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \]

3. **Time Dilation:**
   \[ t' = t \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \]

Unlike many entropic gravity approaches, this framework directly derives particle masses, cosmic acceleration, and galaxy rotation without fitted parameters, offering a predictive, falsifiable model. It aligns theoretical consistency with observational data, bridging quantum foundations and cosmology.
